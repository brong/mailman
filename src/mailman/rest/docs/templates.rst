 Templates
===========

In Mailman 3.1 a new template system was introduced to allow for maximum
flexibility in the format and content of messages sent by and through Mailman.
For example, when a new member joins a list, a welcome message is sent to that
member.  The welcome message is created from a template found by a URL
associated with a template name and a context.

So if for example, you want to include links to pages on your website, you can
create a custom template, make it available via download from a URL, and then
associate that URL with a mailing list's welcome message.  Some standard
placeholders can be defined in the template, and these will be filled in by
Mailman when the welcome message is sent.

The URL itself can have placeholders, and this allows for additional
flexibility when looking up the content.


Examples
========

Let's say you have a mailing list::

    >>> from mailman.app.lifecycle import create_list
    >>> ant = create_list('ant@example.com')

The standard welcome message doesn't have any links to it because by default
Mailman doesn't know about any web user interface front-end.  When Anne is
subscribed to the mailing list, she sees this plain welcome message.

    >>> from mailman.testing.helpers import subscribe
    >>> from mailman.testing.helpers import get_queue_messages
    >>> anne = subscribe(ant, 'Anne')
    >>> items = get_queue_messages('virgin')
    >>> print(items[0].msg)
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
    Subject: Welcome to the "Ant" mailing list
    From: ant-request@example.com
    To: Anne Person <aperson@example.com>
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    Welcome to the "Ant" mailing list!
    <BLANKLINE>
    To post to this list, send your message to:
    <BLANKLINE>
      ant@example.com
    <BLANKLINE>
    You can unsubscribe or make adjustments to your options via email by
    sending a message to:
    <BLANKLINE>
      ant-request@example.com
    <BLANKLINE>
    with the word 'help' in the subject or body (don't include the
    quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.  You will
    need your password to change your options, but for security purposes,
    this password is not included here.  If you have forgotten your
    password you will need to reset it via the web UI.

Let's say though that you wanted to provide a link to a Code of Conduct in the
welcome message.  You publish both the code of conduct and the welcome message
pointing to the code on your website.  Now you can tell the mailing list to
use this welcome message instead of the default one.

    >>> from mailman.testing.documentation import call_http
    >>> call_http('http://localhost:9001/3.1/lists/ant.example.com/uris', {
    ...     'list:user:notice:welcome': 'http://localhost:8180/welcome_1.txt',
    ...     }, method='PATCH')
    date: ...
    server: ...
    status: 204

The name of the template corresponding to the welcome message is
`list:user:notice:welcome` and the location of your new welcome message text
is at `http://localhost:8180/welcome_1.txt`.

Now when a new member subscribes to the mailing list, they'll see the new
welcome message.

    >>> bill = subscribe(ant, 'Bill')
    >>> items = get_queue_messages('virgin')
    >>> print(items[0].msg)
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
    Subject: Welcome to the "Ant" mailing list
    From: ant-request@example.com
    To: Bill Person <bperson@example.com>
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    Welcome to the "Ant" mailing list!
    <BLANKLINE>
    To post to this list, send your email to:
    <BLANKLINE>
      ant@example.com
    <BLANKLINE>
    There is a Code of Conduct for this mailing list which you can view at
    http://www.example.com/code-of-conduct.html

It's even possible to require a username and password (Basic Auth) for
retrieving the welcome message.

    >>> call_http('http://localhost:9001/3.1/lists/ant.example.com/uris', {
    ...     'list:user:notice:welcome': 'http://localhost:8180/welcome_2.txt',
    ...     'username': 'anne',
    ...     'password': 'is special',
    ...     }, method='PATCH')
    date: ...
    server: ...
    status: 204

The username and password will be used to retrieve the welcome text.

    >>> cris = subscribe(ant, 'Cris')
    >>> items = get_queue_messages('virgin')
    >>> print(items[0].msg)
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
    Subject: Welcome to the "Ant" mailing list
    From: ant-request@example.com
    To: Cris Person <cperson@example.com>
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    I'm glad you made it!

The text is cached so subsequent uses don't necessarily need to hit the
internet.

    >>> dave = subscribe(ant, 'Dave')
    >>> items = get_queue_messages('virgin')
    >>> print(items[0].msg)
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
    Subject: Welcome to the "Ant" mailing list
    From: ant-request@example.com
    To: Dave Person <dperson@example.com>
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    I'm glad you made it!


Template format
===============

Mailman expects the templates to be return as content type
`text/plain; charset="UTF-8"`.

Template URLs can be any of the following schemes:

* `http://` - standard scheme supported by the requests_ library;
* `https://` - standard scheme also supported by requests_;
* `file:///` - any path on the local file system; UTF-8 contents by default;
* `mailman:///` - a path defined within the Mailman source code tree.  It is
  not recommended that you use these; they are primarily provided for
  `Mailman's internal use`_.

Generally, if a template is not defined or not found, the empty string is
used.  IOW, a missing template does not cause an error, it simply causes the
named template to be blank.


Line wrapping
=============

Many, but not all, templates have their text wrapped at column 70. This can
result in a nicer looking result but can also break long URLs. To avoid this,
you can indent any lines you don't want wrapped by one or more spaces which
will inhibit wrapping of those lines. Here are some examples.

    >>> text = """Here's some sample text
    ... that should be wrapped and filled to make a pretty looking paragraph of text with no excessively short
    ... or long lines, but it also contains a long url.
    ...
    ... https://www.example.com/mailman3/lists/mailman-users.mailman3.org/members/options/user@example.org?role=member
    ...
    ... which shouldn't be wrapped.
    ... """

The normal template wrapping process produces

    >>> from mailman.utilities.string import wrap
    >>> print(wrap(text))
    Here's some sample text that should be wrapped and filled to make a
    pretty looking paragraph of text with no excessively short or long
    lines, but it also contains a long url.
    <BLANKLINE>
    https://www.example.com/mailman3/lists/mailman-users.mailman3.org/memb
    ers/options/user@example.org?role=member
    <BLANKLINE>
    which shouldn't be wrapped.

We see the URL is wrapped and we don't want that so we insert a leading
blank.

    >>> import re
    >>> text = re.sub('\nhttps', '\n https', text)
    >>> print(wrap(text))
    Here's some sample text that should be wrapped and filled to make a
    pretty looking paragraph of text with no excessively short or long
    lines, but it also contains a long url.
    <BLANKLINE>
     https://www.example.com/mailman3/lists/mailman-users.mailman3.org/members/options/user@example.org?role=member
    <BLANKLINE>
    which shouldn't be wrapped.


URL placeholders
================

The URLs themselves can contain placeholders, and this can be used to provide
even more flexibility in the way the template texts are retrieved.  Two common
placeholders include the List-ID and the mailing list's preferred language
code.

    >>> ant.preferred_language = 'fr'
    >>> call_http('http://localhost:9001/3.1/lists/ant.example.com/uris', {
    ...     'list:user:notice:welcome':
    ...     'http://localhost:8180/$list_id/$language/welcome_3.txt',
    ...     }, method='PATCH')
    date: ...
    server: ...
    status: 204

The next person to subscribe will get a French welcome message.

    >>> dave = subscribe(ant, 'Elle')
    >>> items = get_queue_messages('virgin')
    >>> print(items[0].msg)
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
    Subject: =?iso-8859-1?q?Bienvenue_sur_la_liste_de_diffusion_=AB_Ant_=BB?=
    From: ant-request@example.com
    To: Elle Person <eperson@example.com>
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    Je suis heureux que vous pouvez nous rejoindre!

Standard URL substitutions include:

* `$list_id` - The mailing list's List-ID (`ant.example.com`)
* `$listname` - The mailing list's fully qualified list name
  (`ant@example.com`)
* `$domain_name` - The mailing list's domain name (`example.com`)
* `$language` - The language code for the mailing list's preferred language
  (`fr`)


Template contexts
=================

When Mailman is looking for a template, it always searches for it in up to
three *contexts*, and you can set the template for any of these three
contexts: a mailing list, a domain, the site.

Most templates are searched first by the mailing list, then by domain, then by
site.  One notable exception is the ``domain:admin:notice:new-list`` template,
which is sent when a new mailing list is created.  Because (modulo any style
default settings) there won't be a template for the newly created mailing
list, this template is always searched for first in the domain, and then in
the site.

In fact, this illustrates a common naming scheme for templates.  The
colon-separated sections usually follow the form
``<context>:<recipient>:<type>:<name>`` where ``context`` would be "domain" or
"list, ``<recipient>`` would be "admin", "user", or "member", and ``<type>``
can be "action" or "notice".  This isn't a strict naming scheme, but it does
give you some indication as to the use of the template.  All template names
used internally by Mailman are given below.

You've already seen how the mailing list context works above.  Let's look at
the domain and site contexts next.


Domain context
--------------

Let's say you want all mailing lists in a given domain to share exactly the
same welcome message template.  Remember that Mailman will insert
substitutions into the templates themselves to customize them for each mailing
list, so in general a single template can be shared by all mailing lists in
the domain.

The first thing to do is to set the URI for the welcome message in the domain
to be shared.

    >>> call_http('http://localhost:9001/3.1/domains/example.com/uris', {
    ...     'list:user:notice:welcome':
    ...     'http://localhost:8180/welcome_4.txt',
    ...     }, method='PATCH')
    date: ...
    server: ...
    status: 204

And let's create a new mailing list in this domain.

    >>> bee = create_list('bee@example.com')

Now when Anne subscribes to the Bee mailing list, she will get this
domain-wide welcome message.

    >>> anne = subscribe(bee, 'Anne')
    >>> items = get_queue_messages('virgin')
    >>> print(items[0].msg)
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
    Subject: Welcome to the "Bee" mailing list
    From: bee-request@example.com
    To: Anne Person <aperson@example.com>
    ...
    Welcome to the Bee list in the example.com domain.

So far so good.  What happens if Fred subscribes to the Ant mailing list?

    >>> fred = subscribe(ant, 'Fred')
    >>> items = get_queue_messages('virgin')
    >>> print(items[0].msg)
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
    Subject: =?iso-8859-1?q?Bienvenue_sur_la_liste_de_diffusion_=AB_Ant_=BB?=
    From: ant-request@example.com
    To: Fred Person <fperson@example.com>
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    Je suis heureux que vous pouvez nous rejoindre!

Okay, that's strange!  Why did Fred get the French welcome message?  It's
because the mailing list context overrides the domain context!  Similarly, a
domain context overrides a site context.  This allows you to provide generic
templates to be used as a default, with specific overrides where necessary.

Let's delete the Ant list's override.

    >>> ant.preferred_language = 'en'
    >>> call_http('http://localhost:9001/3.1/lists/ant.example.com/uris'
    ...           '/list:user:notice:welcome',
    ...           method='DELETE')
    date: ...
    server: ...
    status: 204

Now when Gwen subscribes to the Ant list, she gets the domain's welcome
message.

    >>> gwen = subscribe(ant, 'Gwen')
    >>> items = get_queue_messages('virgin')
    >>> print(items[0].msg)
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
    Subject: Welcome to the "Ant" mailing list
    From: ant-request@example.com
    To: Gwen Person <gperson@example.com>
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    Welcome to the Ant list in the example.com domain.


Site context
------------

Let's say we want the same welcome template for every mailing list on our
Mailman installation.  For this we use the site context.

First, let's delete the domain context we set previously.  Note that
previously we used a `DELETE` method on the list's welcome template resource,
but we could have also done this by PATCHing an empty string for the URI,
which Mailman's REST API interprets as a deletion too.  Let's use this
approach to delete the domain welcome message.

    >>> call_http('http://localhost:9001/3.1/domains/example.com/uris', {
    ...     'list:user:notice:welcome': '',
    ...     }, method='PATCH')
    date: ...
    server: ...
    status: 204

Now let's set a new welcome template URI for the site.

    >>> call_http('http://localhost:9001/3.1/uris', {
    ...     'list:user:notice:welcome':
    ...     'http://localhost:8180/welcome_5.txt',
    ...     }, method='PATCH')
    date: ...
    server: ...
    status: 204

Now Herb subscribes to both the Ant...

    >>> herb = subscribe(ant, 'Herb')
    >>> items = get_queue_messages('virgin')
    >>> print(items[0].msg)
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
    Subject: Welcome to the "Ant" mailing list
    From: ant-request@example.com
    To: Herb Person <hperson@example.com>
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    Yay! You joined the ant@example.com mailing list.

...and Bee mailing lists.

    >>> herb = subscribe(bee, 'Herb')
    >>> items = get_queue_messages('virgin')
    >>> print(items[0].msg)
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
    Subject: Welcome to the "Bee" mailing list
    From: bee-request@example.com
    To: Herb Person <hperson@example.com>
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    Yay! You joined the bee@example.com mailing list.


Templated texts
===============

All the texts that Mailman uses to create or decorate messages can be
associated with a URL.  Mailman looks up templates by name and downloads it
via that URL.  The retrieved text supports placeholders which are filled in by
Mailman.  There are a common set of placeholders most templates support:

* ``listname`` - fully qualified list name (e.g. ``ant@example.com``)
* ``list_id`` - the ``List-ID`` header (e.g. ``ant.example.com``)
* ``display_name`` - the display name of the mailing list (e.g. ``Ant``)
* ``short_listname`` - the local part of the list name (e.g. ``ant``)
* ``domain`` - the domain name part of the list name (e.g. ``example.com``)
* ``description`` - the mailing list's short description text
* ``info`` - the mailing list's longer descriptive text
* ``request_email`` - the email address for the ``-request`` alias
* ``owner_email`` - the email address for the ``-owner`` alias
* ``site_email`` - the email address to reach the owners of the site
* ``language`` - the two letter language code for the list's preferred
  language (e.g. ``en``, ``it``, ``fr``)

Along with these, Mailman supports placeholder as URLs for web interface
when ``base_url`` property is set at the ``Domain`` level. These include:

* ``domain_url`` - URL to homepage for a domain.
* ``mailinglist_url`` - URL to homepage for a mailinglist.
* ``held_message_url`` - URL to page for handling all held messages.
